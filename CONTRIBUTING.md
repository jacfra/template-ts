## Changelog

Issues have labels, milestones, documentation and development insight.

You can generate a seperate branch for each issue on the issue's page on github.

Once a milestone is nearing completion a release candidate branch will be made, from of the previous release, and all of the pull requests from the milestone will be merged.
